            "content": ". Let&#39;s resume our discussion on NLP pipeline. In the previous blog post we completed the first 2 steps of NLP pipeline that is Data aquisition and text cleaning. In this blog post we will cover data pre-processing and feature engineering. . PRE-PROCESSING: . To pre-process your text simply means to bring your text into a form that is predictable and analysable for your task. A task here is a combination of approach and domain. For example, extracting top keywords with TF-IDF (approach) from Tweets (domain) is an example of a Task. . Task = approach + domain . One task’s ideal pre-processing can become another task’s worst nightmare. So take note: text pre-processing is not directly transferable from task to task. . Let’s take a very simple example, let’s say you are trying to discover commonly used words in a news dataset. If your pre-processing step involves removing stopwords because some other task used it, then you are probably going to miss out on some of the common words as you have ALREADY eliminated it. So really, it’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. . Here are some common pre-processing steps used in NLP software: . Preliminaries: Sentence segmentation and word tokenization. | . Frequent steps: Stop word removal, stemming and lemmatization, removing digits/punctuation, lowercasing, etc. | . Advanced processing: POS tagging, parsing, coreference resolution, etc. | . Preliminaries : . While not all steps will be followed in all the NLP pipelines we encounter, the first two are more or less seen everywhere. Let’s take a look at what each of these steps mean. . The NLP can analysis the text by breaking it into sentence(sentence segmentation) and then further into words(words tokenization). . SENTENCE SEGMENTATION : . We may easily divide the text into sentence on the basis of the position of the full stop(.). But what happen if we have Dr.Joy or (….) in our text. . We have NLP libraries which help to overcome these issue. Like NLTK. . import nltk from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize text = &quot;It&#39;s fun to study NLP. Would recommend to all.&quot; print(sent_tokenize(text)) . [nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data... [nltk_data] Unzipping tokenizers/punkt.zip. [&#34;It&#39;s fun to study NLP.&#34;, &#39;Would recommend to all.&#39;] . WORD TOKENIZATION : . To tokenize a sentence into words, we can start with a simple rule to split text into words based on the presence of punctuation marks. The NLTK library allows us to do that. . from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize text = &quot;It&#39;s fun to study NLP. Would recommend to all.&quot; print(word_tokenize(text)) . [&#39;It&#39;, &#34;&#39;s&#34;, &#39;fun&#39;, &#39;to&#39;, &#39;study&#39;, &#39;NLP&#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;Would&#39;, &#39;recommend&#39;, &#39;to&#39;, &#39;all&#39;, &#39;.&#39;] . Frequent Steps : . Some frequent steps for pre-processing steps are: . Lower casing | Removal of Punctuations | Removal of Stopwords | Removal of Frequent words | Stemming | Lemmatization | Removal of emojis | Removal of emoticons | . Well these steps are frequent but they may vary problem to problem. For e.g. let us consider we want to predict whether the given text belong to news, music or any other field. So for this problem we cannot remove the Frequent words like news article might contain the word news in it a lot, Hence to categorize the text we cannot just remove it. . Now you might be wondering what is lemmatization and stemming are. So before we move forward lets understand these terms. . Stemming and Lemmatization helps us to achieve the root forms (sometimes called synonyms in search context) of inflected (derived) words. . Stemming : . Stemming is faster because it chops words without knowing the context of the words in given sentences. . It is rule-based approach. | Accuracy is less. | When we convert any words into root-form then stemming may create the non-existence meaning of a word. | Stemming is preferred when the meaning of the word is not important for analysis. For e.g in spam detection. | For example : Studies =&gt; Studi | . from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer porter_stemmer = PorterStemmer() word_data = &quot;Da Vinci Code is such an amazing book to read.The book is full of suspense and Thriller. One of the best work of Dan Brown.&quot; # First Word tokenization nltk_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(word_data) #Next find the roots of the word for w in nltk_tokens: print(&quot;Actual: %s Stem: %s&quot; % (w,porter_stemmer.stem(w))) .

Lemmatization : . Lemmatization is slower as compared to stemming but it knows the context of the word before proceeding. . It is a dictionary-based approach. | Accuracy is more as compared to Stemming. | Lemmatization always gives the dictionary meaning word while converting into root-form. | Lemmatization would be recommended when the meaning of the word is important for analysis. for example in Question Answer application. | For Example: “Studies” =&gt; “Study” | . from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer wordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer() word_data = &quot;Da Vinci Code is such an amazing book to read.The book is full of suspense and Thriller. One of the best work of Dan Brown.&quot; nltk_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(word_data) for w in nltk_tokens: print(&quot;Actual: %s Lemma: %s&quot; % (w,wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(w))) .

Lemma: . . Some other pre-processing steps that are not that common are: . Text Normalization: . Text normalization is the process of transforming a text into a canonical (standard) form. For example, the word “gooood” and “gud” can be transformed to “good”, its canonical form. Another example is mapping of near identical words such as “stopwords”, “stop-words” and “stop words” to just “stopwords”. . Language Detection: . Well what happen if our text is in other language apart from English. Then our whole pipeline need to be modified according to that language. So for that we need to detect the language before creating the pipeline. Python provides various modules for language detection. . langdetect | textblob | langrid | . from langdetect import detect # Specifying the language for # detection print(detect(&quot;Geeksforgeeks is a computer science portal for geeks&quot;)) print(detect(&quot;Geeksforgeeks - это компьютерный портал для гиков&quot;)) print(detect(&quot;Geeksforgeeks es un portal informático para geeks&quot;)) print(detect(&quot;Geeksforgeeks是面向极客的计算机科学门户&quot;)) print(detect(&quot;Geeksforgeeks geeks के लिए एक कंप्यूटर विज्ञान पोर्टल है&quot;)) print(detect(&quot;Geeksforgeeksは、ギーク向けのコンピューターサイエンスポータルです。&quot;)) . en ru es no hi ja . Advance Processing . POS Tagging : . Imagine we’re asked to develop a system to identify person and organization names in our company’s collection of one million documents. The common pre-processing steps we discussed earlier may not be relevant in this context. Identifying names requires us to be able to do POS tagging, as identifying proper nouns can be useful in identifying person and organization names. Pre-trained and readily usable POS taggers are implemented in NLP libraries such as NLTK, spaCy and Parsey McParseface Tagger. . tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog&quot;) print(&quot;Part of speech&quot;,nltk.pos_tag(tokens)) . Part of speech [(&#39;The&#39;, &#39;DT&#39;), (&#39;quick&#39;, &#39;JJ&#39;), (&#39;brown&#39;, &#39;NN&#39;), (&#39;fox&#39;, &#39;NN&#39;), (&#39;jumps&#39;, &#39;VBZ&#39;), (&#39;over&#39;, &#39;IN&#39;), (&#39;a&#39;, &#39;DT&#39;), (&#39;lazy&#39;, &#39;JJ&#39;), (&#39;dog&#39;, &#39;NN&#39;)] . Parse Tree: . Now if we have to find the relationship between person and organization then we need to analyse the sentence in depth and for that parse tree play a major role. Parse tree is a tree representation of different syntactic categories of a sentence. It helps us to understand the syntactical structure of a sentence. . from nltk import pos_tag, word_tokenize, RegexpParser # Example text sample_text = &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot; # Find all parts of speech in above sentence tagged = pos_tag(word_tokenize(sample_text)) #Extract all parts of speech from any text chunker = RegexpParser(&quot;&quot;&quot; NP: {&lt;DT&gt;?&lt;JJ&gt;*&lt;NN&gt;} #To extract Noun Phrases P: {&lt;IN&gt;} #To extract Prepositions V: {&lt;V.*&gt;} #To extract Verbs PP: {&lt;P&gt; &lt;NP&gt;} #To extract Prepostional Phrases VP: {&lt;V&gt; &lt;NP|PP&gt;*} #To extarct Verb Phrases &quot;&quot;&quot;) # Print all parts of speech in above sentence output = chunker.parse(tagged) print(&quot;After Extracting n&quot;, output) . After Extracting (S (NP The/DT quick/JJ brown/NN) (NP fox/NN) (VP (V jumps/VBZ) (PP (P over/IN) (NP the/DT lazy/JJ dog/NN)))) . Conference Resolution : . Coreference resolution is the task of finding all expressions that refer to the same entity in a text. . . FEATURE ENGINEERING: . When we use ML methods to perform our modeling step later, we’ll still need a way to feed this pre-processed text into an ML algorithm. Feature engineering refers to the set of methods that will accomplish this task. It’s also referred to as feature extraction. The goal of feature engineering is to capture the characteristics of the text into a numeric vector that can be understood by the ML algorithms. . two different approaches taken in practice for feature engineering in . classical NLP and traditional ML pipeline . Feature engineering is an integral step in any ML pipeline. Feature engineering steps convert the raw data into a format that can be consumed by a machine. These transformation functions are usually handcrafted in the classical ML pipeline, aligning to the task at hand. For example, imagine a task of sentiment classification on product reviews in e-commerce. One way to convert the reviews into meaningful “numbers” that helps predict the reviews’ sentiments (positive or negative) would be to count the number of positive and negative words in each review. There are statistical measures for understanding if a feature is useful for a task or not. . One of the advantages of handcrafted features is that the model remains interpretable—it’s possible to quantify exactly how much each feature is influencing the model prediction. . DL pipeline . In the DL pipeline, the raw data (after pre-processing) is directly fed to a model.The model is capable of “learning” features from the data. Hence, these features are more in line with the task at hand, so they generally give improved performance. But, since all these features are learned via model parameters, the model loses interpretability. . RECAP: . The first step in the process of developing any NLP system is to collect data relevant to the given task. Even if we’re building a rule-based system, we still need some data to design and test our rules. The data we get is seldom(rarely) clean, and this is where text cleaning comes into play. After cleaning, text data often has a lot of variations and needs to be converted into a canonical (principle or a pre-defined way) form. This is done in the pre-processing step. This is followed by feature engineering, where we carve out indicators that are most suitable for the task at hand.These indicators/features are converted into a format that is understandable by modeling algorithms. . Note: In the future blog post indepth implementation will be done,so don&#8217;t worry if things seemed little hazzy:) . 2.

            "content": "If we were asked to build an NLP application, think about how we would approach doing so at an organization. We would normally walk through the requirements and break the problem down into several sub-problems, then try to develop a step-by-step procedure to solve them. Since language processing is involved, we would also list all the forms of text processing needed at each step. . This step-by-step processing of text is known as a NLP pipeline. It is the series of steps involved in building any NLP model. . . The key stages in the pipeline are as follows: . Data acquisition . | Text cleaning . | Pre-processing . | Feature engineering . | Modeling . | Evaluation . | Deployment . | Monitoring and model updating . | Before we dive into NLP applications implementation the first and foremost thing is to get a clear picture about it’s pipeline. Hence, below are a detail overview about each component in it&#39;s pipeline. . Note: The blog post on NLP pipeline is divided into 3 blog post. The first blog post covers the Data acquisition and Text Cleaning. Second blog post covers Pre-processing and Feature engineering and the 3rd blog post covers modeling, Evaluation, Deployment and Moniotring and model updating. . DATA ACQUISITION . Data plays a major role in the NLP pipeline. Hence it&#39;s quite important that how we collect the relevant data for our NLP project. . Sometime it&#39;s easily available to us. But sometime extra effort need to be done to collect these precious data. . 1).Scrape web pages . To create an application that can summarizes the top news into just 100 words .For that you need to scrape the data from the current affairs websites and webpages. . 2).Data Augmentation . NLP has a bunch of techniques through which we can take a small dataset and use some tricks to create more data. These tricks are also called data augmentation, and they try to exploit language properties to create text that is syntactically similar to source text data. They may appear as hacks, but they work very well in practice. Let’s look at some of them: . a).Back translation . Let say we have sentence s1 which is in French. We will translate it to other language (in this case English) and after translation it become sentence s2. Now we will translate this sentence s2 again to French and now it become s3. We’ll find that S1 and S3 are very similar in meaning but there is slight variations. Now we can add S3 to our dataset. . b).Replacing Entities . To create more dataset we will replace the entities name with other entities. Let say s1 is &quot;I want to go to New York&quot;, here we will replace New York with other entity name for e.g. New Jersey. . c).Synonym Replacement . Randomly choose “k” words in a sentence that are not stop words. Replace these words with their synonyms. . d).Bigram flipping . Divide the sentence into bigrams. Take one bigram at random and flip it. For example: “I am going to the supermarket.” Here, we take the bigram “going to” and replace it with the flipped one: “to Going.” . TEXT CLEANING . After collecting data it is also important that data need to be in the form that is understood by computer. Consider the text contains different symbols and words which doesn&#39;t convey meaning to the model while training. So we will remove them before feeding to the model in an efficient way. This method is called Data Cleaning. Different Text Cleaning process are as follows: . HTML tag cleaning . Well when collecting the data we scrap through various web pages. Beautiful Soup and Scrapy, which provide a range of utilities to parse web pages.Hence the text we collect does not have any HTML tag in it. . from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import urllib.request import re url = &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence&quot; page = urllib.request.urlopen(url) # connect to website try: page = urllib.request.urlopen(url) except: print(&quot;An error occured.&quot;) soup = BeautifulSoup(page, &#39;html.parser&#39;) regex = re.compile(&#39;^tocsection-&#39;) content_lis = soup.find_all(&#39;li&#39;, attrs={&#39;class&#39;: regex}) content = [] for li in content_lis: content.append(li.getText().split(&#39; n&#39;)[0]) print(content) .

Unicode Normalization: . While cleaning the data we may also encounter various Unicode characters, including symbols, emojis, and other graphic characters. To parse such non-textual symbols and special characters, we use Unicode normalization. This means that the text we see should be converted into some form of binary representation to store in a computer. This process is known as text encoding. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; import emoji text = emoji.emojize(&quot;Python is fun :red_heart:&quot;) print(text) . Python is fun ❤ . Text = text.encode(&quot;utf-8&quot;) print(Text) . b&#39;Python is fun xe2 x9d xa4&#39; . Spelling Correction . The data that we have might have some spelling mistake because of fast typing the text or using short hand or slang that are used on social media like twitter. Using these data may not result in better prediction by our model therefore it is quite important to handle these data before feeding it to the model. we don’t have a robust method to fix this, but we still can make good attempts to mitigate the issue. Microsoft released a REST API that can be used in Python for potential spell checking. . System-Specific Error Correction . What if we need to extract the data from the PDF. Different PDF documents are encoded differently, and sometimes, we may not be able to extract the full text, or the structure of the text may get messed up. There are several libraries, such as PyPDF, PDFMiner, etc., to extract text from PDF documents but they are far from perfect. . | Another common source of textual data is scanned documents. Text extraction from scanned documents is typically done through optical character recognition (OCR), using libraries such as Tesseract. . | . Recap . The first step in the process of developing any NLP system is to collect data relevant to the given task. Even if we’re building a rule-based system, we still need some data to design and test our rules. The data we get is seldom(rarely) clean, and this is where text cleaning comes into play. . 1.
