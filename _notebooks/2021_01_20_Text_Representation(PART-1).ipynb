    "## What is Text Representation?\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP the game is all about text. Text that we collect and provide to our computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the text we provide cannot be comprehend by our NLP or machine Learning algorithm?\n",
    "Well this nightmare is true because as we know our algorithm cannot handle the text. It might not get the simple English(or any other language text) which we easily grasp. \n",
    "\n",
    "Number is something that computer always love. So isn't it's better that we convert our text into suitable numeric format.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conversion of raw text to a suitable numerical form is called text representation.*\n",

    "\n",
    "* Text are represented with a vectors of numbers that are called Vector Space Model(VSM).\n",
    "* VSM is fundamental to many information-retrieval operations, from scoring documents on a query to document classification and document clustering. \n",
    "* It’s a mathematical model that represents text units as vectors.\n",
    "* In the simplest form, these are vectors of identifiers, such as index numbers in a corpus vocabulary. \n",
    "* In this setting, the most common way to calculate similarity between two text blobs is using cosine similarity.\n",
    ">Note:The cosine of the angle between their corresponding vectors. The cosine of 0° is 1 and the cosine of 180° is –1, with the cosine monotonically decreasing from 0° to 180°. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given two vectors, A and B, each with n components, the similarity between them is computed as follows:\n",

    "## Basic Vectorization Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand different Basic vectorization approaches let’s take a toy corpus with only four documents—D 1 , D 2 , D 3 , D 4 —as an example.\n",

    "<img src = \"my_icons/topic_03.1.c.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The vocabulary of this corpus is comprised of six words: **[dog, bites, man, eats, meat, food]**. We can organize the vocabulary in any order. In this example, we simply take the order in which the words appear in the corpus.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "* In one-hot encoding, each word w in the corpus vocabulary is given aunique integer ID w id that is between 1 and |V|, where V is the set of the corpus vocabulary. \n",
    "* Each word is then represented by a V-dimensional binary vector of 0s and 1s. This is done via a |V| dimension vector filled with all 0s except the index, where index = w id . \n",
    "* At this index, we simply put a 1. The representation for individual words is then combined to form a sentence representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of toy dataset:** \n",
    "* We first map each of the six words to unique IDs: dog = 1, bites = 2, man = 3, meat = 4 , food = 5, eats = 6.\n",
    "* Now for D1 “dog bites man” each word is a six-dimensional vector. \n",
    "* Dog is represented as [1 0 0 0 0 0], as the word “dog” is mapped to ID 1. Bites is represented as [0 1 0 0 0 0], and so on and so forth. Thus, D1 is represented as [ [1 0 0 0 0 0] [0 1 0 0 0 0] [0 0 1 0 0 0]]. \n",

    "The key idea behind it is as follows:\n",

    "* BoW maps words to unique integer IDs between 1 and |V|. \n",
    "* Each document in the corpus is then converted into a vector of |V| dimensions where in the i th component of the vector, i = w id , is simply the number of times the word w occurs in the document, i.e., we simply score each word in V by their occurrence count in the document.\n",
