    "\n",
    "Data plays a major role in the NLP pipeline. Hence it's quite important that how we collect the relevant data for our NLP project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometime it's easily available to us. But sometime extra effort need to be done to collect  these precious data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1).Scrape web pages:  \n",
    "To create an application that can summarizes the top news into just 100 words . So for that you need to scrape the data from the current affairs websites and webpages. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2).Data Augmentation:\n",
    "NLP has a bunch of techniques through which we can take a small dataset and use some tricks to create more data. These tricks are also called data augmentation, and they try to exploit language properties to create text that is syntactically similar to source text data. They may appear as hacks, but they work very well in practice. Let’s look at some of them: \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3).Back translation : \n",
    "Let say we have sentence s1 which is in French. We will translate it to other language (in this case English) and after translation it become sentence s2. Now we will translate this sentence s2 to again French and now it become s3. We’ll find that S1 and S3 are very similar in meaning but are slight variations of each other. Now we can add S3 to our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4).Replacing Entities: \n",
    "To create more dataset we will replace the entities name with other entities. Let say s1 is \"I want to go to New York\", here we will replace New York with other entity name for e.g. New Jersey. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## 5).Synonym Replacement:\n",
    "Randomly choose “k” words in a sentence that are not stop words. Replace these words with their synonyms. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## 6).Bigram flipping: \n",
    "Divide the sentence into bigrams. Take one bigram at random and flip it. For example: “I am going to the supermarket.” Here, we take the bigram “going to” and replace it with the flipped one: “to Going.” \n",

    "After  collecting data it is also important that data need to be in the form that is understood by computer. Consider the text contains different symbols and words which doesn't convey meaning to the model while training. So we will remove them before feeding to the model in an efficient way. This method is called Data Cleaning. Different Text Cleaning process are as follows:  \n",

These transformation functions are usually handcrafted in the classical ML pipeline, aligning to the task at hand. For example, imagine a task of sentiment classification on product reviews in e-commerce. One way to convert the reviews into meaningful “numbers” that helps predict the reviews’ sentiments (positive or negative) would be to count the number of positive and negative words in each review. There are statistical measures for understanding if a feature is useful for a task or not. \n",

Hence, these features are more in line with the task at hand, so they generally give improved performance.

Even if we’re building a rule-based system, we still need some data to design and test our rules. The data we get is seldom(rarely) clean, and this is where text cleaning comes into play. After cleaning, text data often has a lot of variations and needs to be converted into a canonical (principle or a pre-defined way) form. This is done in the pre-processing step. This is followed by feature engineering, where we carve out indicators that are most suitable for the task at hand. \n",
