        "Feature engineering is an integral step in any ML pipeline. Feature engineering steps convert the raw data into a format that can be consumed by a machine. These transformation functions are usually handcrafted in the classical ML pipeline, aligning to the task at hand. For example, imagine a task of sentiment classification on product reviews in e-commerce. One way to convert the reviews into meaningful “numbers” that helps predict the reviews’ sentiments (positive or negative) would be to count the number of positive and negative words in each review. There are statistical measures for understanding if a feature is useful for a task or not. \n",
        "\n",
        "One of the advantages of handcrafted features is that the model remains interpretable—it’s possible to quantify exactly how much each feature is influencing the model prediction. \n",

        "In the DL pipeline, the raw data (after pre-processing) is directly fed to a model.The model is capable of “learning” features from the data. Hence, these features are more in line with the task at hand, so they generally give improved performance. But, since all these features are learned via model parameters, the model loses interpretability. \n",

        "The first step in the process of developing any NLP system is to collect data relevant to the given task. Even if we’re building a rule-based system, we still need some data to design and test our rules. The data we get is seldom(rarely) clean, and this is where text cleaning comes into play. After cleaning, text data often has a lot of variations and needs to be converted into a canonical (principle or a pre-defined way) form. This is done in the pre-processing step. This is followed by feature engineering, where we carve out indicators that are most suitable for the task at hand. \n",
